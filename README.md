# Project Summary

In this project we are building a front end for an employee management system.  It should run on any modern browser (post I.E. 8 and similar), and be fully functional, and reasonably styled.  Chrome will be our recommended browser.

## Current Desired Functionality

### Employee List

The application will load a simulated list of employees, and allow modifications to each.  Clicking the employee from the list to the side will bring their file up in the editor.

#### Add Employee

"Add Employee" option at the bottom will allow a new employee record to be created, defaulting with the name and title "New Employee", phone number (111)111-1111, and an ID number one greater than the last employee created, so that IDs are never repeated.

### Selected Employee

Your employee will consist of:

* ID
* Name
* Phone
* Title

All fields except for ID are editable.  

*ID* - Should be whole numbers between 0 and 9999
*Name* - Any characters allowed, to a maximum of 30 characters
*Phone* - Must be a 10 digit phone number
* Accepted as regular digits or formatted as a US number
* If entered as the former will be displayed as the latter
*Title* - Any characters allowed, to a maximum of 30 characters
*Email* - Any valid email address, to a maximum of 30 characters

#### Save, Cancel, Delete

*Save*: When saving a change, it will persist as you access other records and navigate back to the desired employee.
* If there are unacceptable entries in the fields, an error message will pop up advising the users as to the errors they need to fix.

*Cancel*: The cancel button will revert the employee's file back to the most recently saved version.

*Delete*: The delete button will remove the employee record, and is irriversable.  A dialogue asking the user to confirm their desire to remove the record will be presented.

The save and cancel buttons will only be accessible when modifications have been made.

#### Search

* The search bar will compare any inputs to all fields on all employees, and filter the employee list for any employee that has at least one match.
* The clear button will empty the search field and revert to display ALL employees.
* Adding, modifying, or deleting employees while the search field is populated will update the results.

## Loose API Documentation

The API's base url is currently https://peaceful-inlet-88854.herokuapp.com/api/employees
Basic API documentation is as follows:
* GET: will return an array of employees
* POST: will add an employee if the Body of the request contains a JSON with the properties id, name, phone, email, and title
* PUT: will edit an existing employee when sent to api/employees/{employeeId} with parameters of name, phone, email, and title
* Note, ID is not editable
* DELETE: will delete an existing employee when the request is sent to api/employees/{employeeId}
* Any request will return an array of the current employees in the database.

*Note*: A postman collection with functional API requests for this project has been added to the repository
    `Employee Manager.postman_collection.json`.
